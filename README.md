# Simple Mandelbrot

### Description

The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal. \
It visualizes complex dynamics, where points inside the set remain bounded under iteration, \
creating intricate, self-repeating patterns often seen in mathematical art.

### About the project

It's Mandelbrot with simple features. Dive infinitely deep into its intricate patterns.
This project was one of my goals to train and improve my skills and C++ knowledge.
It was really fun :) This needs more improvisation in the future.

### How to use?

**WASD** - Use keys to move around. \
**Left click** - Zoom in and focus on your Cursor. \
**Right click** - Reset back to default.

### Install

you can build with `cmake`

Have installed `cmake` package before running in the terminal.
```BASH
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After those steps, you get one file in the build folder, run `./Mandelbrot` in the terminal.

Have fun! :)
